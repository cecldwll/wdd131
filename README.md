This course builds on prior experience in Web Fundamentals and programming. Students will learn to create dynamic websites that use JavaScript to respond to events, update content, and create responsive user experiences.

For the personal site project, I worked on a photography portfolio site, to learn, practice, and demonstrate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
